A 2D fighting game built with Python and Pygame, where players face a multi-level AI system, ranging from random behavior to learning and adapting to player tactics.

## üåü Project Overview

This project was born from the idea of creating a single-player fighting game experience with depth. The core problem it solves is creating an AI opponent that is intelligent and challenging enough to keep players engaged. To address this, we developed a 3-level AI system, with the highest level capable of remembering, analyzing, and predicting the player's behavior to launch counter-attacks.

Through building this project, we enhanced our skills in game development with Pygame, AI system design, game state management, and performance optimization. This project taught us the importance of a well-organized codebase (OOP) and how to simulate intelligent behavior using heuristic algorithms.

## üöÄ Technologies Used

*   **Language:** Python 3
*   **Library:** Pygame
*   **Architecture:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
*   **Development Tools:**
    *   **IDE:** Visual Studio Code
    *   **Version Control:** Git

## ‚ú® Key Features

#### üîç 1. In-depth 1v1 Fighting System

*   **HP & SP Mechanics:** Manage Health to survive and Stamina to use skills.
*   **Combo Chains:** Execute 3-hit normal attack combos to maximize damage.
*   **Special Moves:** Each character has a unique and powerful special move.
*   **Aerial Combat:** Attack and move flexibly in the air, including double jumps.

#### üë§ 2. Two Unique Characters

*   **Fire Knight:** Superior strength, high health, and good defense, but slow.
*   **Wind Hashashin:** High speed and fast combos, but has low health and weak defense.

Each character has a distinct set of stats, skills, and animations defined in the configuration file, allowing for a variety of strategic matchups.

#### ü§ñ 3. Multi-Level AI System

*   **Easy (Random):** The AI performs actions completely randomly, serving as an initial challenge for new players.
*   **Medium (Rule-Based):** The AI follows a predefined set of rules (e.g., "If the player is close, attack").
*   **Hard (Heuristic):** The AI can predict player actions, maintain optimal distance, and choose the right moment to attack. It can learn and counter based on your habits.

#### üõ°Ô∏è 4. Advanced Combat Mechanics

*   **Blocking:** Reduce incoming damage and regain SP on a successful block.
*   **Dodging & I-Frames:** Dodge to gain a short period of invincibility (200ms) to avoid critical attacks.
*   **Tech Roll:** An advanced defensive skill that allows you to roll away immediately after being hit to escape combos.

#### ‚ù§Ô∏è 5. Complete Game Loop

*   **Menu & Tutorial:** A main menu and a detailed guide screen for new players.
*   **Round System:** A "Best of 3" format with a round timer.
*   **Results Screen:** A Game Over screen that announces the winner and allows for a rematch.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Design

#### Key Design Principles

*   **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**
    *   `Fighter Class`: A single class manages all states and actions for both the player and the AI, maximizing code reusability.
    *   `Game Class`: The main class that controls the game loop, states (menu, in-game, game over), and events.
*   **State Management:** A `game_state` variable is used to control the application flow, from the main menu to character select and the fight itself.
*   **Configuration-Driven Design:** All character stats and game parameters (health, speed, damage) are stored in `config.py`, making it easy to edit and balance the game without changing the core logic.

#### Benefits Achieved

*   **Easy to Maintain & Extend:** The modular structure makes it simple to fix bugs, add new characters, or integrate new AI algorithms.
*   **Flexible:** Game parameters can be easily tweaked to create different experiences.
*   **Highly Reusable:** The logic of the `Fighter` class is applied to both the player and the AI.

## üìä Outcomes & Lessons Learned

#### Technical Skills Developed:

*   **Game Development with Pygame:** Mastered the game loop, input handling, animations, and sound.
*   **Object-Oriented Design:** Applied OOP principles to build a well-structured and scalable system.
*   **Basic AI Logic:** Understood and implemented AI algorithms from simple to complex in a real-world environment.
*   **State Management:** Gained experience in managing different states of a complex application.

#### Key Takeaways:

*   **The Importance of Architecture:** Investing time in initial design makes future development and maintenance significantly easier.
*   **Separation of Data and Logic:** Using a `config.py` file is a valuable lesson in keeping the core logic clean and flexible.
*   **AI is More Than Just Algorithms:** To make an AI feel more "human," logic must be combined with elements like delays and randomness.
